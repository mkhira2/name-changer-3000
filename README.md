# Hashiru

As a marathon runner, I know that mental toughness is just as important as physical conditioning when it comes to making it to the finish line of a race. Hashiru is an app designed to make that mental training easier by "gameifying" the training experience, encouraging runners through the hardest times of marathon training. Hashiru allows runners to begin a marathon training plan, record their runs, and earn achievements as they get closer to marathon day. Runners will be rewarded with badges and motivational quotes when they hit certain mileage milestones along the course of their training plan. This app has already been used successfully by runners who have completed the Chicago, Boston, and New York Marathons.
